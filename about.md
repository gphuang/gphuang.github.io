Currently I am a research scientist at SILO.AI, Helsinki. I received my Ph.D. and B.Sc. degree from School of EEE, NTU, Singapore in 2013 and 2008 respectively.

I enjoy working on machine learning problems and developing practical solutions. My work has revolved around the challenges in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP), with a focus on acoustic-phonetics and language modeling.
